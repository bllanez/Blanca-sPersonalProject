Blanca's Personal Project 
============================

More than anything this group project taught me how to work well with people more than anything. I was expecting to build a website from scratch, but the ability to learn WordPress was 
sort of a blessing. It is simple to use and easy to learn, and extremely quick. It gives anyone the build a website. I really enjoyed learning more about WordPress and being able
to work with SkyTouch to see how to take a WordPress and transform it into something better than just a regular theme. 


Pages
============================
This is just a simple set up of the webpages.
